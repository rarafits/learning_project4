This repository is about hypothesis testing concepts
In this session's assignment, I worked on two questions related to descriptive statistics and statistical inference.

1. Calculate the descriptive statistics for the exam scores after vs. before taking the module. What can be concluded?
2. The Paired T-test is a variation of the T-test where a sample is measured twice (typically before vs. after a treatment). Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the students' exam scores improved after receiving the module or not.
   
The data used involved the exam results of students before and after receiving specialized module training.
The main focus of the analysis was to determine the effectiveness of providing the additional module.
